Mapping genes in Pseudomonas associated with pathogenicity

This repository contains scripts for analyzing tnseq data and pathology testing data to identify the genes underlying differences in pathogenicity.

## Image Analysis
For image analysis we utilize a modified version of Ilja's RAPA pipeline. Ilja has a detailed wiki on how to install the RAPA pipeline:

## Assocation Mapping
We utilize several methods for association mapping

(1) EMMA with P/A polymorphisms

(2) Kmer analysis


## Tnseq Analysis
In parallel with the mapping, we have accrued a genetic knockout library
