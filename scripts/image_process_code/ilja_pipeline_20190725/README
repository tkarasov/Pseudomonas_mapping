1. Copy the contents of this folder to your experimental directory.
2. Check the run.bash script and adjust IMAGE_DIR and images wildcard if
   needed

3. Prepare your mask:
   Needs to be an indexed 8bit (256 color) png file, with transparent
   background.
   Individual positions are differenciated by subsequent colors. GIMP can be
   used to create the mask.
   Start with one color, e.g. number 50. This will correspond to pot 0. Use
   'Fill with foreground color' to fill a selected region with this color.
   Next pot must have the color number 51, and so on.
   Repeat this process until all pots are marked.
4. run run.bash
