Read in map of who was where


Read in data from green pixels and merge with pos map


Now plot the green pixels

Let's do a comparison between the avrE and hrc with WT

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  greenp_mutant_WT$Green_pixels and greenp_mutant_hrc$Green_pixels
## W = 19, p-value = 0.2037
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```

```
## 
## 	Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction
## 
## data:  greenp_mutant_WT$Green_pixels and greenp_mutant_AVRE$Green_pixels
## W = 19, p-value = 0.3235
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
```


Now let's look at colonies from 8.26.2019
